### Marketing Lead at TALLER DIGITAL BUSINESS - Agile Software Development Company - (October 2014 to May 2016) Brazil

Head of all marketing activities, as events, brand management, digital activation, sales support, reporting, and analytics management for the marketing department. 

I was responsible for the strategy, planning, and execution of all marketing & digital communication projects such as e.g a full rebranding of the company including the launch of a new website, blog, and other several marketing touchpoints.

Being in a startup environment with a (very!) limited budget makes you creative, agile, and collaborative. I had a big focus on small improvements on organic social channels, SEO, content marketing, and brand reputation with the developer community in Brazil.

I worked close to the sales and engineer teams to support the overall company, and market needs.
