## Professional Experience
#### Software engineer in QA at [Appear.in](http://appear.in) (current job)
I help the team creating amazing e2e tests with the [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) framework, and these tests are executed in our CI system for each pull request that is created, providing fast feedback after each change in the system. I'm always learning new ways of doing my job better, and I'm a believer of agile and lean methodologies.

**Projects:**

- [Appear.in](http://appear.in)

**Stack:** NodeJS, AngularJS and Protractor.

#### Software Developer and agile testing coach at Taller Digital Business (June 2014 – May 2016)
At first I was hired as QA to create automated acceptance tests in Gherkin format, but with some time I helped the company in a big transformation, where software test is not a phase during the software development process, but part of it. In this transformation I changed my position to software developer, helping the team on developing features and also as agile testing coach, sharing knowledge about agile testing through all the company.
At this position I worked firstly using Scrum, and then we evolve for using Kanban and a continuous flow.

**Projects:**

- [Natura Relatório Anual](http://www.natura.com.br/relatorio-anual)
- [Natura Consumidor Final](http://www.natura.com.br/)
- [Adoro Maquiagem](http://adoromaquiagem.com.br/)
- [FIESC-SENAI Portal/Sistema Espaço do Estudante](http://estudante.sc.senai.br/)
- [Preço Info](http://precoinfo.com.br)

**Stack:** Drupal, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, SASS, Protractor, Cucumber and Vagrant.


#### QA at ADP (April 2011 – May 2014)
At APD I worked in two different project (both as QA), but in the first we developed automated tests in Java (using Selenium), and in the 2nd we developed automated tests in VBScript (using QTP). Also, here I had my first contact with agile methodologies, such as Scrum. I was also lead of an internal project called Tech Talks.

**Stack:** Java, VBScript and SQL.

#### Manual and automated test analyst at Good Card (November 2009 - March 2011)
In this job I had my first contact with software test automation, having to make my manager understand that software test automation is not record and playback. At this company I started the creation of a test automation framework. Part of my job was also creating unit tests for triggers and procedures (since many business rules were in the database), creating and executing manual test cases and managing bugs.

**Stack:** Javascript and SQL


## Projects and Community Contribution
#### [Protractor Drupal Framework](https://github.com/TallerWebSolutions/protractor-drupal-framework)
